# StackBasedTextEditor
Description:

The Stack-Based Text Editor is a command-line text editor that allows users to perform basic text editing operations such as inserting and deleting characters, navigating through the text using cursor movements, and undoing or redoing the most recent edits. It utilizes stacks to efficiently manage and revert editing actions, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Introduction:

In today's digital age, text editors are essential tools for programmers, writers, and everyday computer users. The Stack-Based Text Editor is designed to meet the needs of users who require a simple yet powerful tool to manage text efficiently. This application is particularly useful in scenarios where users need to frequently undo or redo changes, such as in coding or document editing.

 The primary data structures used in this application are a string to store the text, an integer to track the cursor position, and two stacks to manage undo and redo operations. Stacks are particularly suitable for this problem because they provide a straightforward way to manage the Last In, First Out (LIFO) nature of undo and redo actions. Each edit operation is pushed onto the stack, allowing the application to easily revert to previous states or reapply changes, ensuring an efficient and user-friendly editing process
